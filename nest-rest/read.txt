controllers handles the route
we can have more than one controller
all route with child must come before the route that takes param
This order is very important

the provider handles the logic for our controller
we create the logic in the provider and inject it.

The data in our routes are not being validated and this can lead to further problems. It returns status ok with any data which is wrong
This is where Pipes comes in. They are used to transform data or to validate the data.


DataTransformObject schema helps to hold parameter types definition in one place. This helps to avoid defining them all around

the checks are already extended to the update types so we dont need to apply validation on it.
